# Election_Analysis
# Project Overview
A Colorade Board of Elections employee requests the following tasks be completed to execute an audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidate who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percantage of vote each candidate won
5. Determin the winner fo the election based on popular vote

The purpose of this project is to provide the election results to the Board of Elections in a clear, simple, and easy format in a timely manner. 

# List of Resources and software
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6 and Visual Studio Code 1.58

# Election Audit Summary
Using scripts, like the one presented here, to audit election results can provide a timely and accurate response to calls for election results or recounts. This process can also be used to analyze early voting data, the day of voting, and mail-in voting options. Doing this can allows for Board of Election members to see how their constituents vote (early, day-of, or mail in). This can also be used to analyze which political party gained the most votes state wide or by county. Of course, this would require more data to be provided (vote options and political affiliations) in the CSV file than was given for this particualr challenge. 

# Challenge Overview
The challenge was to analyze a csv file that contained election results. The tools I used were Python, VS Code, Git Bash, and GitHub. There were many tasks that included sorting through the file to consolidate candidate names and counties. Then the tasks moved towards computating the total number of votes, votes per candidate, percentage of votes per candidate, and determining the overall winner of the popular vote. These tasks were required to be displayed on a separate txt_file then where the code was written. Throughout the challenge, I updated my GitHub through the Git Bash application. 

# Challenge Summary
The biggest lesson learned for me during this challenge was that I need to pay attention to typos and placement of lines of code. Most errors I expereinced were mistyped words or I wrote the line of code out of order.

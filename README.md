# Election_Analysis
# Project Overview
A Colorade Board of Elections employee requests the following tasks be completed to execute an audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidate who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percantage of vote each candidate won
5. Determin the winner fo the election based on popular vote

# List of Resources and software
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6 and Visual Studio Code 1.58

# Summary of findings
Here is the analysis of the election data:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
- The winnder of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

# Challenge Overview
The challenge was to analyze a csv file that contained election results. The tools I used were Python, VS Code, Git Bash, and GitHub. There were many tasks that included sorting through the file to consolidate candidate names and counties. Then the tasks moved towards computating the total number of votes, votes per candidate, percentage of votes per candidate, and determining the overall winner of the popular vote. These tasks were required to be displayed on a separate txt_file then where the code was written. Throughout the challenge, I updated my GitHub through the Git Bash application. 

# Challenge Summary
The biggest lesson learned for me during this challenge was that I need to pay attention to typos and placement of lines of code. Most errors I expereinced were mistyped words or I wrote the line of code out of order.
